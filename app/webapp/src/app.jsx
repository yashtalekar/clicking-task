              We are conducting an academic study about mouse control and video game background. 
              We need to understand if there is a difference in performance on the clicking task
              based on background knowledge of video games. We will also record your mouse clicks
              to try and assess your performance. You will receive the credit for
              performing our task. Information sheet:{" "}
